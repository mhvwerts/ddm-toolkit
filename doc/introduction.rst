============
Introduction
============

These documents will become the documentation of the DDM Toolkit. At present, first refer to the ``README.rst`` of the `DDM Toolkit GitHub repository`_ .

.. _DDM Toolkit GitHub repository: https://github.com/mhvwerts/ddm-toolkit

We aim to use `Sphinx`_ for managing the document of DDM Toolkit. To this end we have put in place the present ``doc`` directory, using ``sphinx-quickstart`` and following the `"first steps" instructions`_.

.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org
.. _"first steps" instructions: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html

The native format for Sphinx documents is ReStructuredText (RST), so we will use that. Incidentally, NumPy docstring (that we use for documenting the code) are also a flavour of RST.


To do
=====

- Simplify the ``README.rst`` of the GitHub repository, and move the details to this documentation.
- Organize the documentation.
- Add the (NumPy-style) docstrings in the Toolkit's code to the automatic Sphinx documentation.
- Improve the docstrings of the code.
